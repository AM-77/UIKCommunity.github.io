                <p><br>UIK Community is a community intended for collaboration and learning in the student community. We value the participation of each member of the student community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.<br><br>Accordingly,
                    all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the Event/Workshop. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this &nbsp;Event/Workshop are required to conform to the following
                    Code of Conduct. Organizers and University of IBN Khaldoun Tiaret officials will enforce this code throughout the Event/Workshop.<br><br></p>
                <h1>The code<br></h1>
                <p><br>Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments, hacks, or other online activity related to gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, physical appearance, race,
                    religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.<br><br>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If participants
                    fail to comply they will be asked to leave the event.<br><br>Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary comments and hacks can be offensive to those around you.<br><br>If
                    a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the hackathon organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon<br><br></p>
